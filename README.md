# UnityHelloWorlds
This is just a Unity project meant to contain test, utities and demos that are meant to be used in other projects. In the planning stage for this project there are going to be utility scripts/demos for moving and rotating cameras, moving objects along predetermined paths or generating new static and dynamic paths, and more.  Come back often to see whats new.

This readme is also the first one I've made in a while so bare with me while I keep the unity template readme file up for a while just to get my bearings again.
